This project is made only for Desktop and the code has circular dependencies and is not optimized, also used as few third party libraries as possible
PS: in the future I will add mobix and optimize the code.



In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
